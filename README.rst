 * - Annotation Problem
   -
   - Annotation problems ask students to respond to questions about a
     specific block of text. The question appears above the text when the
     student hovers the mouse over the highlighted text so that students can
     think about the question as they read.
 * - Example Poll
   - Conditional Module
   - You can create a conditional module to control versions of content that
      groups of students see. For example, students who answer "Yes" to a
      poll question then see a different block of text from the students who
      answer "No" to that question.
 * - Example JavaScript Problem
   - Custom JavaScript
   - Custom JavaScript display and grading problems (also called *custom
     JavaScript problems* or *JS input problems*) allow you to create a
     custom problem or tool that uses JavaScript and then add the problem or
     tool directly into Studio.
